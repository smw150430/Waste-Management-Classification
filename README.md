# Waste Management Classification

Contributor: Stephen Williams

## Goal 
This project aims to classify images into organic and recyclable/non-organic categories.  I have concerned myself with this to compose a means to efficiently identify and ultimately automate waste management.  Currently, the burden of sorting waste is left to individual households and the like.  Given their unreliable temperments, it would be preferable to circumvent the human element in the waste management process.
