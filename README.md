# Waste Management Classification

Contributor: Stephen Williams

## Goal 
This project aims to classify images into organic and recyclable categories.  Given the prevalence of global warming and environmental negligence in the various news outlets worldwide, I have concerned myself with a subset of such things, waste management.  The aforementioned model will permit for automating a subset of the waste management process.
